# Gestura – Home Users GUI

Gestura Home Users GUI is a Windows desktop application that provides a clean and intuitive graphical interface for end users of the Gestura gesture-based interaction system.

This repository hosts the **standalone Windows `.exe` application**, intended strictly for home users and demonstrations. It abstracts all backend complexity and focuses on usability, stability, and a modern desktop experience.

## Overview

The Gestura Home Users GUI serves as the front-end control panel for gesture interaction, allowing users to monitor system status and interact with Gestura without requiring technical knowledge or manual configuration.

The application is distributed as a prebuilt executable and does not require Python, additional runtimes, or external dependencies.
